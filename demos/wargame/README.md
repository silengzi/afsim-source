# wargame demo

This scenario is a demonstration of a simple wargame using Warlock. The scenario is best experienced with multiple players to take control of the four playable teams. The four teams, while of different colors, should have identical assets. Each player's team has available two fighters, a sam, a bomber, a sensor drone and a base.

The objective is for a player to use their assets to the best of their ability to destroy the opposing player's bases, while also defending their own. On start up, assets will follow predefined routes until directed otherwise.

Upon the loss of a base, a player will lose their remaining platforms in the 
scenario and receive a "Game Over" message. The last player with their base
in tact wins!

This directory contains six different start-up files:

* blue_team.txt - blue player startup
* green_team.txt - green player startup
* red_team.txt - red player startup
* purple_team.txt - purple player startup
* white_cell.txt - non-playable character for viewing the game
* single_player_scenario.txt - allows access and visibility of all teams
